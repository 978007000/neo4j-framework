Neorank test in Python
======================

This is the most basic test comparing the classic 
pagerank with its variant using a discrete random
walker on the network.

Please make sure networkx and pylab are installed 
on your system to play around with the parameter 
set.

To install, please use PIP (can be installed using 
homebrew on Mac or apt-get (Ubuntu) /yum (Fedora) 
or similar package manager on Linux)
